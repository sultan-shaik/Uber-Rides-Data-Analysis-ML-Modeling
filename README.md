# Uber Rides Data Analysis and ML Modeling

Welcome to the "Uber Rides Data Analysis and ML Modeling" project repository! This project involves performing a detailed analysis and implementing machine learning models on Uber rides data recorded between 2009-01-01 and 2015-06-30.

## Project Overview

Uber, a leading rideshare company, collects extensive data on rides, including pickup and dropoff locations, fare amounts, passenger counts, and more. This project aims to uncover insights from this dataset and build predictive models to estimate fare amounts for rides.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a wide range of information about Uber rides, including:

- Pickup and dropoff coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- Fare amounts
- Passenger counts
- Pickup datetime

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project's structure and contents:

## Getting Started

To explore and run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:
Project Highlights
Data Analysis: Explore the dataset to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
Machine Learning Modeling: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict fare amounts for Uber rides.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R^2).
 After training and evaluating multiple regression models, including Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting, the Random Forest Regressor model has demonstrated the best performance in predicting fare amounts for rides. Here is a summary of the results:

### Random Forest Regressor Model Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.2767124051659446
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 30.732797589820013
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 5.543716947123113
- R-squared (R^2): 0.7043643268283213

### Fare Prediction for New Data secunderabad to hyderabad:
For a new ride with the following characteristics:
- Pickup Longitude: 78.5014
- Pickup Latitude: 17.4423
- Dropoff Longitude: 78.4867
- Dropoff Latitude: 17.3850
- Passenger Count: 2

The Random Forest Regressor model predicts a fare amount of [21.07373964251449].

### Conclusion:
Based on the evaluation metrics and the fare prediction results for the new data, the Random Forest Regressor model appears to be the most accurate and reliable for predicting fare amounts in this dataset.

Further optimization and tuning of the model may lead to even better results, but for now, it represents a strong choice for fare prediction in the given context.

Feel free to explore the detailed code and evaluation results in the notebook for more insights into the model's performance.
 In our analysis of various regression models for predicting fare amounts in the rides dataset, we performed a comprehensive comparison of model performance. Among the models considered, Linear Regression demonstrated the least adjusted R-squared value. Here is a summary of our findings:

### Model Evaluation Metrics:
- Linear Regression: 0.0010267280254037114
- Random Forest Regression: 0.6196167268808194
- Gradient Boosting Regression: 0.6773389254219284

### Linear Regression Model:
The Linear Regression model is a fundamental and interpretable regression technique. However, in our analysis, it yielded an adjusted R-squared value of [ 0.0010267280254037114]. This indicates that the model may not be capturing the underlying relationships in the data as effectively as other models.

### Model Comparison:
- Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor outperformed Linear Regression in terms of adjusted R-squared. They demonstrated better fitting to the dataset and the ability to explain variance in fare amounts.

### Recommendations:
Based on our evaluation, we recommend considering Random Forest Regressor or Gradient Boosting Regressor for fare prediction tasks. These models have shown better predictive capabilities and have achieved higher adjusted R-squared values.

While Linear Regression provides interpretability, it may not be the best choice for this particular dataset due to its lower adjusted R-squared value.

Further model optimization and feature engineering may lead to improved predictive performance. It is essential to explore various models and techniques to select the most suitable one for the specific problem at hand.
